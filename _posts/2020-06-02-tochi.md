Our It's all in the timing ToCHI paper just got featured on a [Yale-NUS press release](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/smart-devices-should-space-out-vibrations-to-maximise-user-alert-benefits-and-minimise-distractions/).

The project behind \"Itâ€™s all in the timing\" started back in 2017, as a student capstone (final year) project in collaboration with Assistant Professor Christopher Asplund (Psychology). After a year of data gathering, we submitted it to CHI where the paper got good feedback. The paper ultimately did not make it as it did not clearly highlight actionable/usable results from the studies. We thus resubmitted to ToCHI where we got excellent comments and suggested improvements.

One interesting aspect of the project is its multidisciplinary aspect, and how we (as HCI researchers) can work with and learn from psychology researchers.

In case you did not do it yet, please have a look at the paper either on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09100.pdf) or [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386358).
