In November 2019, my lab and I hosted the ACM SIGCHI SEA Summer School 2019. The event brought researchers and practitioner from many different countries together for a three days event.
Participants came from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines.

During the event, we shared insights on how to do HCI research and how to write papers. It was a great opportunity for everyone to meet new friends and share about their research interests.
